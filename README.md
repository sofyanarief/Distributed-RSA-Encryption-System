# Distributed RSA Encryption System

This project are focused to implement distributed computing in RSA encryption system. Implementation of distributed computing are limited only in encrypion and decryption process. So key generation process are still not using distributed computing. And if you have an idea for implement distributed computing in key generation process, kindly fork and send me pull request.

# How to use

Clone this repo and manual edit Broker.py to fit your needs then run that file in python 2.7 compiler.

## Release note
### [Version 1.0](https://github.com/sofyanarief/Distributed-RSA-Encryption-System/releases/tag/1.0) 
- Manual edit Broker.py (no shell interaction)
- Distributed computing has been implemented by number of available workers
### [Version 2.0](https://github.com/sofyanarief/Distributed-RSA-Encryption-System/releases/tag/2.0)
- Still need to edit manually Broker.py (no shell interaction)
- Distributed computing has been implemented by available resources on workers
